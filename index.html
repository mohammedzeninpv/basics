        The Cross Temple is a former place of worship in Fangshan, Beijing. Built as a Buddhist temple, it may have seen
        Christian use during the Tang dynasty (618–907). The temple was used by Buddhists during the Liao dynasty
        (916–1125) and by Christians during the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), returned to Buddhist use during the Ming
        dynasty (1368–1644), and was sold in 1911. Its first modern mention was in 1919. The Cross Temple was damaged
        during the Cultural Revolution but recognised as a national-level protected site in 2006. Some scholars consider
        it to be the only place of worship of the Church of the East (also known as Nestorian Christianity) discovered
        in China. In the early 20th century, two stone blocks carved with crosses were discovered, one of which had an
        inscription in Syriac; they are presently on display at Nanjing Museum. Today, the site features two ancient
        steles (one pictured) dating to the Liao and Yuan dynasties, some groundwork and the bases of several pillars.
